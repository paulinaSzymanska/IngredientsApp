## This app can be run on phone with android with version 29-34
   App was created to help me generate shopping list from pdf recipes
   I had some plans to increase working of app, but i decide that this version is totally
   enough for me. There can be some errors and i am aware of it.

Anyway if you want to use it just fetch repo and run an app on your phone.

Important thing is that if you want to use it, there are few rules needed to be completed when you want
to use this app.

      1. Recipe has to be in polish language.
      2. These pages in pdf format has to have below polish words (i added ignoring cases) :
         - Sk≈Çadniki
         - Przygotowanie

If i will have to much time and i will be coding missing i will do:
   - i will save the content of shopping list in pdf file on phone or in app
   - i will do some general interface for dinner, breakfast etc classes
